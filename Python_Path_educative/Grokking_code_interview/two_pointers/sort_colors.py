"""Solution summary
To summarize, solving this problem involves the following steps:

Traverse the array and swap elements, as required, to organize them correctly.

If the encountered color is red, swap its value with that of the start pointer. If the color is blue, swap its value with that of the end pointer.

White elements are skipped, and pointers are adjusted accordingly.

The array is sorted when the end pointer moves to the left of the current pointer.

Time complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) since weâ€™re only traversing the array once.

Space complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) since no extra space is used.
