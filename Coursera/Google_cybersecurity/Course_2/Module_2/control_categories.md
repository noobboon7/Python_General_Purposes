# Control categories

Controls within cybersecurity are grouped into three main categories:

* **Administrative/Managerial controls** address the human component of cybersecurity. These controls include policies and procedures designed to guide how an organization manages data and employee responsibilities for protecting the organization. Administrative controls often require technical or physical controls for enforcement. 

* **Technical controls** consist of solutions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), antivirus (AV) products, encryption, etc. They can be used in different ways to meet organizational needs.

* **Physical controls ** include door locks, cabinet locks, surveillance cameras, badge readers, etc. These controls are used to limit physical access to assets by unauthorized personnel. 

**Control types**

Control types include, but are not limited to:	

* **Preventative:** Designed to prevent an incident from occurring.
* **Corrective:** Used to restore an asset after an incident has happened.
* **Detective:** Implemented to determine whether an incident has occurred or is in progress.
* **Deterrent:** Designed to discourage attacks.

**Review the following charts for specific details about each type of control and its purpose.**
