You were introduced to the concept of threat actors. As a reminder, a threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk. In this reading, you’ll learn about different types of threat actors. You will also learn about their motivations, intentions, and how they’ve influenced the security industry.

**Threat actor types**

    * Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. 
    * Their intentions and motivations can include:
        * Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources
        * Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents

* **Insider threats**
    * Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. 
    * Their intentions and motivations can include: 
        * Sabotage
        * Corruption
        * Espionage
        * Unauthorized data access or leaks 

* **Hacktivists**
    * Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda...

        * Propaganda
        * Social change campaigns

**Hacker types**

A hacker is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data... There are three main categories of hackers:

* **Authorized hackers (ethical hackers):**  Follow a code of ethics, adhere to the law, and safeguard people and organizations.

* **Semi-authorized hackers (researchers):** Search for vulnerabilities, but don't exploit them.

* **Unauthorized hackers (unethical hackers):**  Malicious threat actors who act illegally to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain. 

**Note:** There are multiple hacker types that fall into one or more of these three categories.

**Other motivations:**

* **New and unskilled threat actors:** 
    * To learn and enhance their hacking skills
    * To seek revenge
    * To exploit security weaknesses using existing malware and tactics.

* **Contracted hackers:**  Can be ethical or unethical; motivated by payment.

* **Vigilante hackers:** Aim to protect the world from unethical hackers.

**Key takeaways**

Threat actors are defined by their malicious intent and hackers are defined by their technical skills and motivations. Understanding their motivations and intentions will help you be better prepared to protect your organization and the people it serves from malicious attacks...
