**Attack types**

* **Password attack** 
    * A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. 
    * **Domain:** Communication and network security

* **Social engineering attack**
    * Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. 
    * **Domain:** Security and risk management

* **Physical attack**
    *  A physical attack is a security incident that affects both digital and physical environments.  
    * **Domain:** Asset security

* **Adversarial artificial intelligence**
    * Adversarial artificial intelligence manipulates artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to conduct attacks more efficiently.
    * **Domains:** Communication and network security; Identity and access management

* **Supply-chain attack**
    * A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. 
    * **Domains:** Security and risk management, Security architecture and engineering, Security operations (potentially others)

* **Cryptographic attack**
    *  A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient.
    * **Domain:** Communication and network security
