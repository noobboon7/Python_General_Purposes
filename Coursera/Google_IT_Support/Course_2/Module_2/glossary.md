**Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD):** CSMA/CD is used to determine when the communications channels are clear and when the device is free to transmit data

**Client:** A device that receives data from a server

**Collision domain:** A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time

**Computer networking:** The full scope of how computers communicate with each other

**Copper cable categories :** These categories have different physical characteristics like the number of twists in the pair of copper wires. These are defined as names like category (or cat) 5, 5e, or 6, and how quickly data can be sent across them and how resistant they are to outside interference are all related to the way the twisted pairs inside are arranged

**Crosstalk:** Crosstalk is when an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another wire

**Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC):** A mathematical transformation that uses polynomial division to create a number that represents a larger set of data. It is an important concept for data integrity and is used all over computing, not just network transmissions

D

**Data packet:** An all-encompassing term that represents any single set of binary data being sent across a network link

**Datalink layer:** The layer in which the first protocols are introduced. This layer is responsible for defining a common way of interpreting signals, so network devices can communicate

**Destination MAC address**: The hardware address of the intended recipient that immediately follows the start frame delimiter

**Modulation:** A way of varying the voltage of a constant electrical charge moving across a standard copper network cable

**Multicast frame:** If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to one, it means you're dealing with a multicast frame. A multicast frame is similarly set to all devices on the local network signal, and it will be accepted or discarded by each device depending on criteria aside from their own hardware MAC address
