## Power Supplies

In this reading, you will learn how to select the correct power supply for a personal computer (PC) to support the main components of the PC. 

**Computer Architecture**

Computer architecture refers to the engineering design of computers and the interconnecting hardware components that together create computing devices that meet functional, performance, and cost goals. Power supplies are part of the hardware layer of a computer’s architecture. You learned earlier about the other major hardware components, including the motherboard, CPUs, RAM, storage, peripherals, expansion slots and cards, etc. These components influence the size and type of power supply a computer needs.

**Selecting a Power Supply**

**Local Input Voltage**

A main consideration when selecting a computer power supply is the voltage delivered to common wall sockets in your country. Power standards for input voltages can vary from country to country. The most common voltage inputs are 110-120 VAC and 220-240 VAC. VAC stands for volts of alternating current. 

* **Voltages in the Americas:** North, Central, and parts of South America use the 110-127 VAC standard for common wall sockets. 
* **Voltages for most of the world:** Most countries use the 220-240 VAC standard for common wall sockets. 

Please visit WorldStandards “Plug, socket & voltage by country: [here](https://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plug-voltage-by-country/)" to find your country’s voltage standards. 

It is important to use the correct voltage power supply or power converter for the computer’s voltage specifications. Here's what could happen if there's a mismatch:

| Computer needs | Wall socket delivers | Result |
|---|---|---|
|220-240VAC | 110-120VAC | Not enough power, computer won't run properly |
| 110-120VAC | 220-240VAC | Too much power, damages computer |

**Options for handling mismatches:**

* Replace the power supply with a compatible unit.
* Use a power supply with a dual-voltage switch.
* Use an external power converter.

**Motherboard Engineering Specifications**

The motherboard and form factor specifications document will provide a list of compatible power supply types to help you select the correct part. 

**Power Consumption of Components**

The number of internal components and peripherals the computer will need to support will also determine the minimum wattage a power supply must provide. Consider the power needs of CPUs, hard drives, GPUs, etc.

**Voltages and Pin Connectors**

The internal hardware components of a computer require varied input voltages to operate. 

* **Voltages:**
    * 3.3V: DIMMs, chipsets, some PCI/AGP cards
    * 5V: SIMMs, disk drive logic, ISA, some voltage regulators
    * 12V: Motors, high-output voltage regulators

* **Pin Connectors:** Modern motherboards use 20-pin or 24-pin connectors. 24-pin is the current standard.

* **Power Supply Connections:** Power supplies have multiple connectors for:
    * Floppy disk drive (obsolete)
    * "Molex" universal (e.g. IDE hard drives, optical drives)
    * SATA drives
    * Graphics cards (6-pin or 8-pin)
    * Motherboard (8-pin or 24-pin)

**Key Takeaways**

When selecting a power supply for a computer, the following items should be taken into consideration:

* Wall socket input voltage standard for the country where the computer will be used.
* The number and power consumption needs of the computer’s internal components.
* The motherboard model and form factor engineering specifications and requirements.
