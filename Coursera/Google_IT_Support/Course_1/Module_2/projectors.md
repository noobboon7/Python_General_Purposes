## Supplemental Reading for Projectors

**Projectors**

Projectors are display devices for when you need to share information with people in the same location! Most projectors can be used just like any other display on a computer, and with a few differences, can be troubleshot just like any other display device. For example, projectors can have dead or stuck pixels, and can acquire image burn-in, just like other types of displays.

**Connectors and Cables**

You will connect a computer to a projector using a display cable like VGA, DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort. When you do this, the computer's operating system will detect a new display. Here are some helpful links for connecting to a projector:

* **Ubuntu:** How to connect another monitor to your computer: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1030740/gnome-in-ubuntu-18-04-and-multi-monitor-setup

Display issues with projectors often come down to worn or damaged connectors and cables. Consider this early in your troubleshooting.

**Device Drivers**

Like other display devices, if your computer doesn't correctly recognize the display resolution of the projector, it may default to a low-resolution mode.  Check the support website for your projector's manufacturer for device drivers.

**Lighting**

Projectors often rely on expensive, incandescent bulbs (lamps).  Issues include:

* **Overheating:**  Can cause the projector to shut down.
* **Burn out:** The projector won't work or will shut down. 

LED projectors are becoming more common, having fewer overheating issues and longer lifespans than incandescent lamps.

**Calibration**

Sometimes you'll need to calibrate the projector image to account for the distance and angle of installation (especially after moving the projector). This involves focusing the image and making adjustments to correct for skewing or keystoning. Refer to the vendor documentation for the calibration process.
