Release
=======

As a technology user, you may be familiar with alerts on your computing devices for new releases of the software or applications you’ve downloaded. A release, in the software development world, is a new version of a piece of software. For example, Apple released a new Mac operating system (OS), Ventura, to replace Monterey in 2022. Microsoft released Windows 11 to replace Windows 10 in 2021. There are several parts and processes involved in carrying out a release, and therefore, project management, especially agile, is key to ensure the process goes smoothly. The agile approach has become popular in software development because it focuses on short sprints where incremental changes are implemented, tested, and sent out to end users.

Release management
------------------

Release management uses project management methods with CI/CD DevOps tools to produce, document, and release stable new versions of software (“releases”). Release managers, who are in charge of overseeing the release process, coordinate among multiple teams and orchestrate the whole process to make sure the project goes according to plan and meets deadlines. The concepts and processes associated with release management include:

* **Release planning:** Release management begins with detailed release planning. It involves setting the scope of the software build, identifying the features and changes to be included, and setting release goals and timelines.

* **Versioning:** Versioning assigns unique identifiers to different software versions. Each team may have developed their components independently, resulting in various codebases. Release managers use versioning to keep track of the different parts and ensure a coherent and structured integration of the code.

* **Coordinating development and testing:** Release management ensures smooth coordination between the development and testing phases. As the teams complete their individual work, release managers facilitate integration testing to identify and resolve any issues arising from combining the codebases. They also work with testing teams to create test plans and verify that all components function correctly together.

* **Risk assessment and mitigation:** Release managers identify potential risks associated with the software release and plan mitigation strategies. For example, if the release has conflicts or compatibility issues between the modules developed by different teams, the release manager addresses these risks proactively to prevent disruptions during deployment.

* **Communication and stakeholder management:** Release management involves clear and consistent communication with all stakeholders, including the development teams, testing teams, project managers, and end-users. Regular status updates, progress reports, and discussions are essential to keep everyone informed about the release progress and any adjustments to the plan.

* **Release schedule:** Release managers create a detailed release schedule that outlines the steps leading up to the deployment. This includes code integration deadlines, testing periods, and the final release date. The schedule serves as a roadmap for the teams, ensuring that each phase is completed on time and within the defined scope.

* **Change management:** Throughout the development process, changes are inevitable. Release management establishes a structured change management process to evaluate, approve, and track changes effectively. This ensures that only authorized and tested changes are included in the release build.

* **Documentation and release notes:** As part of the coordination process, release managers oversee the creation of comprehensive release notes and documentation. These documents provide crucial information about the software update, including new features, bug fixes, known issues, and any special instructions for end-users.

Types of release
----------------

Releases are not created equally. There are four types of release.

### Major releases

Major releases are significant updates that introduce substantial changes and new features to the application (e.g., the release of macOS Ventura and Windows 11). These updates often involve major improvements, enhancements, or redesigns that may have a significant impact on the user experience or functionality. Major releases may require extensive testing and development efforts, as they can involve rewriting core components or introducing new infrastructure. Since they bring significant changes, they also have a higher chance of introducing new bugs or issues that need to be addressed in subsequent releases. For example, SoundGrounds is a coffee-drinker-friendly streaming phone app that makes recommendations on music and drinks. A major release from SoundGrounds is when the app introduces new features like personalized playlists or a complete UI overhaul to enhance the user’s streaming experience.

### Minor releases

Minor releases are smaller updates that include additional features, improvements, or minor changes. They are often aimed at enhancing the application's existing functionalities without introducing major overhauls. Minor releases are generally less complex than major releases, as they build upon the existing stable version. However, they still require thorough testing to ensure that the new features integrate seamlessly with the current application. An example is the releases of MacOS Ventura 13.4 and 13.5, which involve bug fixes. For SoundGrounds, a minor release may involve adding features like sleep timer functionality or an integration with a new payment gateway for premium features.

### Patch releases

Patch releases are focused on fixing bugs, vulnerabilities, and addressing critical issues present in the software. They aim to provide quick solutions to problems that affect the application's stability or security. Patch releases are typically smaller in scope and can be deployed more rapidly than major or minor releases. Since they focus on bug fixes, thorough testing is crucial to ensure that the patches do not introduce new issues.

### Hotfix releases

Hotfix releases are immediate updates to address critical and high-priority issues that affect the application's functionality or pose security risks. They are typically rolled out urgently to resolve pressing problems. Hotfix releases undergo minimal testing and are immediately pushed to production to mitigate the impact of urgent problems. For example, Mac OS released hotfixes to resolve issues on bluetooth and other basic tools.

Key takeaways
-------------

A release is a new version of a piece of software. For a company to carry out a release, it involves effective release management–from planning the release scope, coordinating between teams, mitigating potential issues, to meeting the deadlines. There are four types of release: major, minor, patch, and hotfix.
