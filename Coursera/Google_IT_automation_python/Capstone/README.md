# Automating Real-World Tasks with Python

## Project 1 : Scale and convert images using PIL

### Introduction

Your company is in the process of updating its website, and they’ve hired a design contractor to create some new icon graphics for the site. But the contractor has delivered the final designs in the wrong format -- rotated 90° and too large. Oof! You’re not able to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast. You’ll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch.

#### Tasks

Use the Python Imaging Library to do the following to a batch of images:

- Open an image

- Rotate an image

- Resize an image

- Save an image in a specific format in a separate directory

## Project 2 : Process text files with Python dictionaries and upload to running web service

### Introduction

You’re working at a company that sells second-hand cars. Your company constantly collects feedback in the form of customer reviews. Your manager asks you to take those reviews (saved as .txt files) and display them on your company’s website. To do this, you’ll need to write a script to convert those .txt files and process them into Python dictionaries, then upload the data onto your company’s website (currently using Django).

#### Tasks

- Use the Python OS module to process a directory of text files

- Manage information stored in Python dictionaries

- Use the Python requests module to upload content to a running Web service

- Understand basic operations for Python requests like GET and POST methods

## Automatically generate a PDF and send it by email

### Introduction

You work for a company that sells second hand cars. Management wants to get a summary of the amounts of vehicles that have been sold at the end of every month. The company already has a web service which serves sales data at the end of every month but management wants an email to be sent out with an attached PDF so that data is more easily readable.

#### Tasks

- Write a script that summarizes and processes sales data into different categories

- Generate a PDF using Python

- Automatically send a PDF by email

## Project 4: Automate updates to catalog information

### Introduction

You work for an online fruit store, and you need to develop a system that will update the catalog information with data provided by your suppliers. The suppliers send the data as large images with an associated description of the products in two files (.TIF for the image and .txt for the description). The images need to be converted to smaller jpeg images and the text needs to be turned into an HTML file that shows the image and the product description. The contents of the HTML file need to be uploaded to a web service that is already running using Django. You also need to gather the name and weight of all fruits from the .txt files and use a Python request to upload it to your Django server.

You will create a Python script that will process the images and descriptions and then update your company's online website to add the new products.

When the task is complete, the supplier should be notified with an email that indicates the total weight of fruit (in lbs) that were uploaded. The email should have a PDF attached with the name of the fruit and its total weight (in lbs).

Finally, in parallel to the automation running, we want to check the health of the system and send an email if something goes wrong.

#### Tasks

- Write a script that summarizes and processes sales data into different categories

- Generate a PDF using Python

- Automatically send a PDF by email

- Write a script to check the health status of the system
