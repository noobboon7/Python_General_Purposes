The Interview Process
=====================

When you are contacted by a recruiter who’s reaching out to schedule a job interview, you might feel a surge of excitement—along with some nerves. It’s normal to feel a bit apprehensive about the interview process. If you have a better idea of what to expect, however, it can help you feel more confident and prepared. This reading will help you understand how the interview process typically works in the field of IT Automation. Although the interview process can vary widely from one company to another, the process covered in this reading is fairly common in the industry.

Getting contacted by a recruiter
--------------------------------

After you apply for jobs, you may receive a call, email, or message from a recruiter expressing interest in your application and asking to schedule a call or meeting. It’s a good idea to reply to this message as soon as possible—preferably within 24 hours—to show that you are responsive and interested in the position.

Preliminary interview
---------------------

In most cases, the first step in the interview process is a preliminary interview—sometimes called a screening. This usually involves a conversation with a recruiter over the phone, in person, or on a video call.

The preliminary interview is typically shorter than a regular interview and might only last 20 or 30 minutes. The recruiter will share information about the company and the job opening. Then they’ll ask you questions to help them get to know you better and understand your experience and skills. The recruiter will also hold time for you to ask questions about the job. It’s a good idea to have questions prepared beforehand since asking questions helps demonstrate your interest in the position. You might also think of more questions to ask during the interview.

At the end of the preliminary interview, the recruiter will thank you for your time and usually let you know the next steps. If they don’t mention the next steps, feel free to ask. You can also take this opportunity to thank the recruiter for meeting with you and express your interest in the position.

After the interview, send a thank-you note to the recruiter within 24 hours. Email is often the best way to do this. Express your gratitude for their time and briefly restate why you would be a good fit for the position.

Additional interviews
---------------------

Once you’ve passed the preliminary interview stage, you may be invited for another interview. This interview is typically with the hiring manager, the employee in charge of deciding who will be hired. You may also meet with other individuals on the team, or other managers within the department, in a group interview.

This interview is often longer than the preliminary interview. It could be in person, over the phone, or on a video call.

The interview usually opens with introductions and a brief description of the company and job position. Then, the interviewer will ask you questions about your background, skills, experience, and how you work. Next, you’ll have an opportunity to ask questions about the company, the role, and job expectations.

Finally, you’ll hear about next steps and thank everyone for their time as the interview comes to an end.

There may be multiple rounds of interviews, depending on how the company’s interview process works. These additional interviews could be longer, include future teammates or other employees at the company, and feature questions that take more time and thought to answer.

As with the preliminary interview, send a thank you note to the people you interviewed with after each round of interviews. Your thank you note can also be an opportunity to follow up on anything discussed in the interview, such as highlighting a project you worked on, or anything you wish you’d said during the interview but didn’t think of until later.

Final offer
-----------

Now comes the exciting part: receiving a job offer from one or more of the companies you interviewed with. The company may reach out to you by phone or email. After the company extends their initial offer, you can negotiate salary or benefits. When the company provides their final offer, you’ll need to decide whether or not to accept it. Feel free to ask for a day or two to make your decision, but let the company know as soon as you’ve decided.

Building perseverance
---------------------

If the company lets you know that you didn’t get the job, take a moment to process the emotions you might feel. If you’d like, you can let the company know that you appreciate the opportunity to have interviewed and that you’d be interested in any future roles that might be a good fit. You can also ask for feedback on what you could do better next time. Although you might not receive a reply, it demonstrates that you are eager to learn and grow.

Key takeaways
-------------

Interviews are a great opportunity to learn more about a job position and the company you’d be working for. By preparing for the interview process and continuing to persevere in your job search, you’ll be well on your way to building a career in IT Automation.
