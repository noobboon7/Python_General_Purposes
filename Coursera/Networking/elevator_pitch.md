Developing an Elevator Pitch
============================

When interviewing with potential employers, it’s important to communicate who you are, your value as a Python Developer or Automation Engineer, and what you’re searching for in a job. A simple way to do this is with an elevator pitch. An **elevator pitch** is a short, memorable description that explains an idea, business, or service in an easy-to-understand way, typically in 60 seconds or less (the average amount of time of an elevator ride).

While an elevator pitch is usually specific to an idea or a product, you can also use it to sell yourself as a professional to potential employers. In an interview, a strong elevator pitch can be used to stand out to your interviewer. It can be used to help explain why you’re a good fit for the role, or to answer the popular interview question, “tell me about yourself.” This reading helps you prepare your elevator pitch to sell yourself and the value you can provide as a Python Automation professional.

Provide an introduction
-----------------------

Start by providing an introduction. Introduce yourself and give a brief overview of your professional background. Explain some job roles you’ve had, your years of work experience, and the types of industries you’ve worked in. If this is your first Python automation job, mention some of your past roles with transferable skills. Even if you’re interviewing for your first internship or job in Python automation, it’s important to clarify that this is what you want to do as a career. For example, you could say, “I want to apply my excellent technical problem-solving skills to find and implement automation solutions.”

Show your excitement
--------------------

This is where you share your passion for the field and why you want to work in the industry. If you’re motivated to sell products online, mention that. This is also a good time to talk about your goals. For example, you could say, “I love creating automation solutions because it gives me the opportunity to develop new Python functions. Long term, I’d love to develop my knowledge of automation for cloud management.”

Communicate your interest in the company
-----------------------------------------

Communicating why you are interested in the company—and not just the role—is a great way to help the interviewer recognize that you are knowledgeable about the company. For example, if you were interviewing for a position for Google’s Software Development team,  you could say, “Google’s Software Development team has the opportunity to work on software applications that the world uses. As a long-time Google App user, I’m looking forward to the opportunity to be a part of that mission and provide outstanding Python support.”

Elevator Pitch Examples
-----------------------

To bring the structure of an elevator pitch to life, check out three examples of elevator pitches. The first is by Dan, a Software Developer. The second is Sean, a Marketing Manager on the Google Ads team. The third is by Joi, an Associate Product Marketing Manager.

### **Dan**

**Software Developer**

I'm Dan, a software developer with 8 years experience developing solutions for logistics. The most recent solution I developed is a database system that prevents large product shipments from being misdirected to the wrong destinations. Outside of my work with logistics, I develop AI software for websites and create websites for clients using that technology. My passion for software development and problem solving is what led me to some of the top logistics organizations. I love solving problems and helping my clients save time and money.

### **Sean**

**Marketing Manager, Google Ads**

I’m Sean, a Marketing Manager for Google Ads, with over a decade’s worth of experience in the field of digital marketing, most of that with Google.

When I went to school, I didn’t even know this industry existed. I majored in English because I liked reading and writing. My first employer in digital marketing took a chance on me because of my experience with client management and spreadsheets, and they figured they could teach me about digital marketing. I’m glad the industry and I found each other.

Google is always innovating, which means when you work in this field you never stop learning. My first company actually ran a blog all about the latest changes to Google Ads (then called AdWords), and because of my English degree, I took a keen interest in the blog. In a few months, I was managing the blog, and it was through my posts on that site that Google found me.

It’s been wonderful to be on the team that announces the latest changes and updates to Google Ads. Because of my hands-on experience buying ads myself, I can immediately see how somebody’s workflow will change after an announcement. I love being able to tell Google’s story to our advertisers so that companies of all sizes can continue to find success and grow their businesses.

### **Joi**

**Associate Product Marketing Manager**

I’m Joi, an Associate Product Marketing Manager at Google with 10 years experience as a content creator for YouTube and organic social channels.

Outside of work, I run my own beauty e-commerce business, an experience that has helped me develop a plethora of skills around digital marketing and paid advertising, project management and operations.

My entrepreneurial mindset paired with my love for creativity is what led me to a company like Google. I thrive in ambiguity and love strategizing and solving problems from the ground up.

**Key Takeaways**
------------------

Creating a 60 second or less elevator elevator pitch is a great tool to use to quickly share who you are. Use an elevator pitch to introduce yourself to career and business connections in the future. You can even use your elevator pitch in other types of situations, like meeting new friends or new colleagues.
